# Hi 👋, I'm Felix

### Developer and Maker from Germany

I'm a full-stack software engineer, curious about how things work under the hood and passionate about solving real-life problems using code. 
I enjoy creating accessible and user-friendly frontends using Angular and Tailwind, as well as scalable web APIs using C# and .NET.


## 🔧 Tech & Tools
- **Frontend**: TypeScript · Angular (signals, RxJS, Material, Tailwind) · Ionic · Capacitor  
- **Backend**: C# · .NET Core · REST APIs · EF Core  
- **DevOps**: Docker & Docker Compose · Azure DevOps · Linux · Azure Cloud  


## 🛠 Maker Side
Beyond software, I design and 3D-print physical objects:
- Personalized gifts & decorations  
- Parametric 3D models using OpenSCAD  


## 🚀 Projects
Currently, I am focused on building a web API for [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer) to automate the preparation of prints.
